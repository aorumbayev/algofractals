                    A random fractal generation tool that mints the resulting
                    image into an NFT on Algorand Blockchain.<br />
                    The resulting NFT is an ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) with 0
                    decimals in place and total supply of 1 unit.<br />
                    The platform additionally appends the RFC traits into
                    metadata field, platforms like NFTExplorer.io and
                    RandGallery.com render that metadata on their platforms.<br />
                    Fractal generation, font choise, and palletes are all
                    randomly generated on each page restart. In other words
                    every single AlgoFractals NFT is unique and minted on behalf
                    of anyone creating via this platform. <br />Manager wallet
                    is set to the address of the user wallet. That way end user
                    is free to edit the ASA after minting in any way he wants
                    (issuing asset config transactions).

                    <br /><br />Currently only supports Mandelbrot sets. Stay
                    tuned for more randomization and new sets!
